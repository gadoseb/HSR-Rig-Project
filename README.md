# HyCYCLE-Project
This repository contains all the workflow performed in the development of a hydrogen storage testing rig, from the PID, to the reactor rig control and its data analysis according to the specific parameters of the experiments.

## Rig and Reactor Purposes
A small Hydrogen Storage Reactor (HSR) to rapidly ‘cycle’ between absorption and desorption, to study the effect of the cycling condtions on the storage material and its lifetime. The additional vacuum pump is implemented to further push the activation of certain class of materials.

## PID and Rig Building
The rig was built with the use of 4 solenoid valves (SV) and a mass flow controller (MFC) to allow a flow of hydrogen from a main gas line to the reactor and from the reactor to an outlet. The basics function and the OpModes are described in details in the attached PID. The additional vacuum pump is connected through a manual three-way valve system (BV1)
