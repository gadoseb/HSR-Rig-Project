# HyCYCLE-Project
This repository contains all the workflow performed in the development of a hydrogen storage testing rig, from the PID, to the reactor rig control and its data analysis according to the specific parameters of the experiments.

## Rig and Reactor Purposes
A small Hydrogen Storage Reactor (HSR) to rapidly ‘cycle’ between absorption and desorption, to study the effect of the cycling condtions on the storage material and its lifetime. The additional vacuum pump is implemented to further push the activation of certain class of materials.
